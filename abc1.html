    	<h2>Natural World</h2>
    	<p>The natural world is a huge part of our environment.
           It may seem like we live entirely in a man-made world. Cities, towns, homes, schools, cars, roads, and computers are all made by man. But the natural world is all around us, all the time. The earth is under those cities and towns. We breathe the air and drink the water that come from the natural world.!
           
           The sea is the interconnected system of all the Earth's oceanic waters, including the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Southern and Arctic Oceans.[1] However, the word "sea" can also be used for many specific, much smaller bodies of seawater, such as the North Sea or the Red Sea. There is no sharp distinction between seas and oceans, though generally seas are smaller, and are often partly (as marginal seas or particularly as the Mediterranean sea) or wholly (as inland seas) enclosed by land.!!

           Science is the greatest collective endeavor. It contributes to ensuring a longer and healthier life, monitors our health, provides medicine to cure our diseases, alleviates aches and pains, helps us to provide water for our basic needs â€“ including our food, provides energy and makes life more fun, including sports, music, entertainment and the latest communication technology. Last but not least, it nourishes our spirit.!
